## Work done in this project thus far mostly involved modifying a freely available template from the Start Bootstrap website:

- https://startbootstrap.com/theme/agency

## The picture of the otter was taken by me (Nataly Mota) at the Acquarium of Atlanta, a few years ago.

## Tutorials used for help with developing the front-end form development for modals 1 through 3:
- The videos and tutorials that I followed along with through Khan Academy, were from the free "Computer Programming - JavaScript and the Web" course. More specifically, from the section called "HTML/JS: Making Web Pages Interactive." In fact, I completed the subsections called "Get ready to make your webpages interactive," "JS and the DOM," "DOM access methods," "DOM modification," and "DOM events."
### Tutorial from JavaScriptTutorial.net that I used for additional help:
